# konnekta-assignment_1

This project demonstrates a responsive flexbox layout with a CSS preprocessor (SCSS). It features a set of styled cards with varying sizes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project uses SCSS for styling, which needs to be compiled to CSS. Make sure you have Dart Sass installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://sass-lang.com/install](https://sass-lang.com/install).

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/Gouidas/konnekta-assignment_1.git

### Running the App

After cloning the repository, open a terminal at the root of the project directory and run the following command to automatically compile SCSS to CSS whenever a change is made:

sass --watch scss/main.scss:css/main.css

Then open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the application. Whenever you make changes to `scss/main.scss`, they will be immediately compiled to `css/main.css`, and you can refresh the page in your browser to see the changes.
