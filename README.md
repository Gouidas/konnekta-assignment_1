# konnekta-assignment_1

This project demonstrates a responsive flexbox layout with a CSS preprocessor (SCSS). It features a set of styled cards with varying sizes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project uses SCSS for styling, which needs to be compiled to CSS. Make sure you have Dart Sass installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://sass-lang.com/install](https://sass-lang.com/install).

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/Gouidas/konnekta-assignment_1.git

### Running the App

If you want to just view the application, simply open `index.html` in your preferred web browser. The compiled CSS is already included in the project.

If you want to make changes to the SCSS and see them reflected in the application, you'll need to run the SCSS compiler. Open a terminal at the root of the project directory and run the following command to automatically compile SCSS to CSS whenever a change is made:

sass --watch scss/main.scss:css/main.css

Then open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the application. Whenever you make changes to `scss/main.scss`, they will be immediately compiled to `css/main.css`, and you can refresh the page in your browser to see the changes.
